Itâ€™s hard to commit to big ambitious goals. Things that seem miles away. Why even try? Is that even what you want? I find it difficult to figure out what it is I should go all in on. Should I be waiting for inspiration to strike me? Should I be evaluating a bunch of different ideas? How far should I commit? When do I give up and try the next thing?

Living for yourself is tough. You feel obligated to yourself to *maximize*. Maximize the amount of good you do in the world. Maximize the stillness. Achieve maximum peace. But that makes it feel like you could always be doing more. Your efforts will never be enough.
