Hello, welcome to my home on the Internet. This is where I keep all my stuff.

[[/Writing|All of my writing]], more or less.

[[Projects]] I've had some hand in.

I'm active on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@justinfowler)!

## About Me
Right now, I'm a college student. After dropping out of college in 2014, I've returned to finish my bachelor's degree. You can read more about why I did that in [[Why I went back to college]].

Professionally, I'm a skilled Product person, marketer, analyst, and well... generalist. I've primarily worked in startups, or at least startup-like environments, so I'm used to wearing many hats. "That's not my job" isn't in my lexicon. [Here's my resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RS-FxDn3C6V1n4sYl6-icN7DhFKsXJ0r/view?usp=sharing).

I have a few interests that I try to post about here, including hiking, cooking, and reading.
