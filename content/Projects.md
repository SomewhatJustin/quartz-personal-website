# Personal
* I built a [web scraper](https://github.com/SomewhatJustin/UT-Austin-Course-Scraper) to gather every course that UT Austin offers (over 10,000!)
	* Subsequently, I used [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) to build a [semantic search engine](https://github.com/SomewhatJustin/ut-course-search) for those courses
* Using the Chat GPT API and React, I built [Ask a Stoic](https://stoic.justin.how), a way to chat with ancient philosophers
* [My Smoothie Stack](https://github.com/SomewhatJustin/smoothie-stack), a fun and easy way to share smoothie recipes

# Professional
* While at [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/), I helped build the future of asynchronous video interviews inside Indeed's Incubator, owning the job seeker experience as a Product Manager
* While at [Upswing](https://upswing.io), I created Ana, a chatbot for students. This project would go on to become the recipient of a Gates Foundation grant.
