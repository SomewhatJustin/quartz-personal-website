Run for mayor of Austin. If you fall short, wow. What a tale. What a series of learnings.

Run a wildly different campaign that is normal. Think from first principles. Heavily online. Set up social accounts ASAP. Find where the very online Austin people areâ€”the ones that vote. But also need to reach large enough segment.

# Platform
Housing. Make it affordable as hell. How? Build. Encourage YIMBY-ism. Taller buildings.

Make Austin Weird Again.
