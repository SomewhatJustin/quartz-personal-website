I am worried about TikTok's effect on our minds. People say TikTok lets China spy on us, but I think there is another issue. TikTok might be hurting our attention spans.

TikTok is like a drug on the internet. Real drugs are controlled. Some are only sold with a doctor's note, and others are not very strong. There are even illegal drugs that are too dangerous. I think TikTok might be a drug that we need to control.

We should think about who can use TikTok. I am worried about kids and teenagers using it. Test scores are lower around the world, and phones could be the reason. TikTok is a big part of this problem.

In the past, people gave kids and adults harmful drugs like cocaine because they did not know better. Now, we give them TikTok and Instagram. We might look back and see this as a mistake too.
